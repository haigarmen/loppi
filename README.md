# Loppi
Loppi is a new musical instrument using Raspberry Pi with Lots of Pots Shield (https://moderndevice.com/product/lots-of-pots-lop-board-for-raspberry-pi/).

Using Python to read the potentiometers and send data to Pure Data (https://puredata.info/) to generate sequences and audio. The current communication protocol is serial communication but I may try pyOSC to compare performance.
